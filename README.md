# New Zealand Flag Referendum Vote Count

This is a Sankey diagram of NZ flag referendum results. It can be viewed here: http://jayniehaka.github.io/nz-flag-referendum/

Each column represents a vote count. Flags are arranged vertically according to the number of votes at each count. Hover over the rectangles and the links to see how many votes were counted and transferred.

"Not counted" includes all informal, invalid and non-transferable votes. These have been lumped together for simplicity, but you can check out the (source data)[http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/2015_flag_referendum1/results-by-count-report.html] for definitions and a full breakdown.

This diagram was made using the (sankey.js)[https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/sankey] plugin for D3, and the awesome tutorials by (@d3noob)[https://twitter.com/d3noob].
